<h1>About Global Classroom</h1>
<p>
	An exciting thing happened when The Global Classroom initiative was spearheaded by US Synthetic in 2009.  It began when <?= $this->html->link('US Synthetic', 'http://www.ussynthetic.com') ?>, an 800 employee company based in Orem, Utah, united a school in their area with a school in rural Kenya as part of their humanitarian outreach.  US Synthetic is an engineering company that manufactures diamond drill bits that are sold all over the world.

	Troy Holmberg, director of Engineering for Good, the charitable arm of <?= $this->html->link('US Synthetic', 'http://www.ussynthetic.com') ?>, saw how rewarding it was to unite a US school with a desperately needy school in Kenya.  Knowing that Kenya Keys did an outstanding job working with school age kids, both in the US and Kenya, he contacted them to see if they would want to partner with US Synthetic in launching The Global Classroom initiative,  which would link children from the two cultures in a mutual experience of learning and growth.
