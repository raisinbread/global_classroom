<h1>How To Begin</h1>

<h2>STEP 1: PLAN</h2>

<p><strong>Contact Dorothy Winters <a href="mailto:Dorothy@kenyakeys.org">mailto:Dorothy@kenyakeys.org</a> or Rinda Hayes <a href="mailto:rinda@kenyakeys.org">rinda@kenyakeys.org.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Set up a time with Rinda or Dorothy to discuss your objectives, interests and needs.</strong> Choose a sister school and corresponding project.  Each school is different, both in the U.S. and in Kenya.  We want to help you plan a Global Classroom experience that is right for your school or classroom.  Projects can range from  raising money to build desks to building classrooms and latrines.  Or perhaps your school/class would like to focus on books and library assistance.  Nothing is more rewarding than getting books in the hands of children who have never had them!</a>

<p>You could also use our <strong>Strides for Education</strong> program as part of your plan.  It is a fun, easy way to get students involved in helping locally and globally.</p>

<p><strong>Plan activities that will raise funds for your sister school. Make it fun!</strong>   Initiating this plan through the student council and their advisor usually works best.  PTA involvement call also be most helpful.  Or maybe you just have a class that wants to be involved.  Your involvement can be as large or small as you wish.</p>

<h2>STEP 2: LEARN</h2>

<p><strong>Schedule a time to have Kenya Keys educate your group with a fun, interactive presentation about life  in the African bush.</strong>  This can be a whole school assembly or a grade presentation.  Your students will realize how much they have to be grateful for when they see what Kenyan students are up against.  A model Kenyan village, videos and pictures make it all real.</p>

<p>We will also show your students pictures of their sister school and motivate them to take action to make a difference.</p>

<h2>STEP 3: TAKE ACTION</h2>

<p><strong>Work together to raise funds for your sister schoolâ€™s needs.</strong>  There are lots of ways to get the students enthused.   For fundraising ideas, check out our  Fun Fundraising Ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Celebrate the success of the service/fundraising and congratulate the students.</strong>  Consider having an achievement celebration or assembly (optional).  Memorialize your success with pictures in a display at school.  Kenya Keys offers support for all of this.</p>

<h2>WATCH IT UNFOLD</h2>

<p>One of the most rewarding and unique aspects of The Global Classroom is the follow up.  <strong>We will return and show the students how their efforts have impacted their sister school.</strong>  They will get to see photos of their finished projects.  Continuing and building a relationship between the two schools is the best part of all! </p>
