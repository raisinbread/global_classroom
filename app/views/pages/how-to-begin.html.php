<h1>How To Begin</h1>

<h2>Step 1:</h2>
<?= $this->html->image('engineering_for_good.png', array('class' => 'accent right')); ?>
<p>Contact Troy Holmberg of US Synthetic Engineering Good at tholmberg@ussynthetic.com, or Rinda Hayes of Kenya Keys at rinda@kenyakeys.org.</p>
<p><?= $this->html->link('Download our Introduction Flyer by clicking here.', '/pdf/gc_flyer_2011.pdf'); ?></p>

<h2>Step 2:</h2>
<p>Set up a time to discuss your interests, needs, and choose a project. Typically involvement works best coming from the student council, a club faculty advisor, or Parent Teacher Organizations. For example: Do you want to educate your group and give them an appreciation for all they have or are you simply looking for a service project? Do you want to connect with a sister school and find ways to exchange and communicate?</p>

<h2><span>Projects:</span></h2>
<?= $this->html->image('love.png', array('class' => 'accent left')); ?>
<p>Provide school uniforms, build desks, donate books and school supplies, build a school library, add a classroom or latrine facilities to a school in need.</p>
<p>Pick a project that your students will enjoy supporting according to the funds you believe you can raise. Pick a project and sister school to support, and design a service activity to raise funds for your sister school. </p>
<p>Set a goal and a time-frame for participation. Usually shorter, focused campaigns work best.</p>

<h2>Step 3:</h2>
<p>Schedule time to have us educate your youth group in a 45-minute presentation to introduce the program. We will teach them about life in Kenya and have a model Kenyan village that students can experience along with video and pictures from Kenya. We will show your students pictures of their sister school and motivate them to take action to make a difference. The student council or youth leader can pitch the service project scope and timeframe to the students.</p>

<h2>Step 4:</h2>
<p>Do your service projects with the group. Again short, focused campaigns and projects will be more successful.</p>

<h2>Step 5:</h2>
<p>Goal achievement celebration/assembly (optional). Report on the success of the service and congratulate the students on their success. Memorialize if you wish with pictures/photos of the students and the sister school in a display at school.</p>

<h2>Step 6:</h2>
<p>Follow-up/Share with students how their efforts impacted their sister school. Continued contact between schools may include: making a short video, sending letters, photos, exchanging murals painted by the students, exchanging hand-made bracelets, sharing via a common Facebook page, etc.</p>

<p class="highlight">100% of all donations go to Kenyan Students!</p>
