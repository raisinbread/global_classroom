<h1>How it Works</h1>

<p>
	There are numerous school in rural Kenya that are in desperate need of educational essentials.  Most schools lack education materials, desks, books, latrines and classrooms.  <strong>The idea of The Global Classroom links American schools with a school in rural Kenya.</strong>  The hope is that two schools can join together and become ‘sister schools’.
</p>
<p>
	An engaging assembly, filled with videos and photos of the Kenyan students, helps the American students come to feel personally connected to their Kenyan counterparts.  They also come to realize how extremely lucky they are to have access to first rate schools, books and opportunity.  The American school is united through fundraising  and allocating the funds to specific needs at their sister school.  Through careful documentation, the American school will be able to watch as their donations change the school, impacting hundreds of children’s learning potential.   The connection between the schools can be rich and long lasting.

	&quot;Learning about our sister school in Kenya is the highlight of our year.  Our students take such pride in having &quot;adopted&quot; a school across the world!  They love to see the difference their small donations have made.&quot;

		&quot;I had the rare opportunity of being able to visit our sister school in Kenya.  As an art teacher, I was able to take with me a huge mural that my students painted for their sister school.  In turn, the students of that school, who had never held a paintbrush before, were able to paint two large murals that now hang in the lobby of our school.  They are a beautiful symbol of the connection of love and learning between our two schools that are 12,000 miles apart.&quot;
