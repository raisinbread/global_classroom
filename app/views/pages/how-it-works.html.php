<h1>How it Works</h1>

<p>Schools in rural Kenya are in desperate need of the bare essentials.  Most lack educational materials, desks, books, latrines and classrooms.  <strong>The Global Classroom pairs American schools with schools in rural Kenya.</strong>  The two become ‘sister schools’.</p>

<p>After an <strong>engaging assembly</strong> filled with examples of real life experiences in rural Kenya, the American students feel personally connected to their new friends across the globe.  United and motivated, the American students begin working together to fundraise for the specific needs of their sister school.</p>

<p>The funded projects will then be carried out Kenya.  Through photos and videos <strong>the American school will be able to watch as their donations change their sister school, impacting hundreds of children’s learning potential.</strong> The connection between the schools can be rich and long lasting.</p>
