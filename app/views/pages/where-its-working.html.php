<h2>Hawthorne  Elementary School <span>Bahakwenu Primary School</span></h2>

<?= $this->html->image('hawthorne_1.jpg', array('class' => 'accent left')); ?>
<p>Hawthorne Elementary school joined hands with Bahakwenu in 2007, before the Global Classroom had an official title.  Hawthorne students have yearly assemblies where they are able to learn about the learning conditions and challenges for the students they befriend in rural Kenya.</p>

<p>Every year since 2007 Hawthorne has done a &quot;sister project&quot; in Kenya, the most renowned one occurring when Hawthorne art teacher, Shelley Rich, went to Bahakwenu to deliver murals painted by her students.  She worked with the students at Bahakwenu, who had the chance to hold a paint brush for the first time.  The murals they produced now hang in the lobby of Hawthorne Elementary school.</p>

<p>The Hawthorne- produced mural resides in the Taru community library, a library that is used by young and old, in an area where libraries are unheard of.  These murals are vivid illustrations of the loving connection established between two schools.</p>

<h2>Timberline Middle School <span>Mwembeni Primary School</span></h2>

<?= $this->html->image('timberline_1.jpg', array('class' => 'accent left')); ?>
<p>The enthusiastic student council of Timberline Middle School united to pull off a great fundraiser for their Global Classroom match of Mwembeni Primary school.  Mwenbeni  was just a tiny school in the bush, where students met under trees for lack of classrooms.  The lack of facilities kept hundreds of children from attending school.  The ones that did walked miles to get there.  When Mwembeni  got an outstanding new principal, Charles Chebebe, things started to happen.  He contacted Kenya Keys and told about his plight. </p>
<p>Timberline Middle School decided to make a difference for the students of Mwembeni.  A spirited assembly launched their fundraising.</p>
<p>Through class competitions, fun events and sales of treats at lunch, Timberline was able to raise a record $11,000 to make the primary school dreams of the village of Mwembeni come true.</p>

<p>In June 2012, Kenya Keys interns were able to celebrate the opening of a beautiful new classroom and eight latrines, laying the ground work for the school to take one more step on into a primary school campus of learning and achievement.</p>
<p>Very happy Mwembeni Students in front of nearly finished classroom.  Here is the side of the classroom with painted white stones leading to the latrine in the far background.   Below is the finished ‘state of the art’ 8-hole latrine.  It’s soo nice!</p>
<p>Thank you Timberline!</p>

<h2>Merit Academy <span>Mtulu Primary School</span></h2>

<?= $this->html->image('merit_1.jpg', array('class' => 'accent left')); ?>
<p>For ten years the founder of Mtulu primary school had prayed that somehow she would get some assistance for her little school.  The three classrooms that they had were packed full of children.</p>
<p>Other children often met under trees.  The parents were loyal and dedicated to any educational efforts.  But the government money never came, and children who longed to be in school were suffering because of lack of facilities.  Lack of basic latrines was a big issue as well, especially for the girls.  </p>
<?= $this->html->image('merit_2.jpg', array('class' => 'accent right')); ?>
<p>When Mtulu heard that Merit Academy, a charter high school in Springville, Utah was going to join them as a Global Classroom partner, they were thrilled.  Merit Academy has helped Mtulu in 2011 and in 2012, heading up school fundraisers called “Run for the Potty”, where they have raised the money to put in critical latrines and also help build a classroom for Mtulu.  The classroom will soon be built, starting with materials used to start a classroom many years ago that was never finished.  </p>
<p>The whole community of Mtulu celebrates when any educational assistance comes their way!</p>
<p>Thank you Merit Academy, and especially teacher Elizabeth Webster, who headed up the projects and even went to Kenya to see Mtulu!</p>

<h2>North Cache Middle School <span>Meti Primary School</span></h2>

<?= $this->html->image('ncache_1.jpg', array('class' => 'accent left')); ?>
<p>The project at North Cache started with one student, student council member Emma Heath.  Emma wanted to galvanize her school to try to make a positive difference in the world.  She lined up an assembly with Kenya Keys.  Her school became acquainted with the urgent needs in rural Kenya.  And for the first time, they realized how privileged they were to have education and books at their fingertips.  The student council worked hard to pull off numerous events, from dances to community runs to sales of goods. </p>
<?= $this->html->image('ncache_2.jpg', array('class' => 'accent left')); ?>
<p>They raised $3,400 with an additional $1,000 added to it from a donor grant.  With the $4400 they were able to make a huge difference for their sister school, Meti Primary School.  Meti is another rural school that has been waiting for years to expand.  Right now students in the Meti area have to walk as far as 8km to get to a primary school!  Meti  Primary School is just a small one-room building now, but soon North Cache’s donation will add a new classroom that will allow many children to stay in their own community for school.</p>
<?= $this->html->image('ncache_3.jpg', array('class' => 'accent right')); ?>
<p>The local community, parents, teachers and students all came out to welcome us and say thank you to the Global Classroom project they were selected to receive.  We are finalizing the plans to construct a new classroom.  In addition to the one pictured below, this will give them two classrooms for their growing student body.  The two female teachers at the school are recent graduates of the Kenya Keys sponsorship program.</p>
<p>The Meti Community gathers to say, “Thank you students of North Cache!”</p>

<h2>Oakdale Elementary School <span>Taru Primary School</span></h2>

<?= $this->html->image('oakdale_1.jpg', array('class' => 'accent left')); ?>
<p>The students at Oakdale elementary school were organized and energized by a student named Sophie Greenwood.</p>
<?= $this->html->image('oakdale_2.jpg', array('class' => 'accent right')); ?>
<p>As her mother writes, &quot;We had the most wonderful experience with my daughter's coin drive.  Our school has just about 650 students and I swear, every one of them probably brought in something!  We had piggy banks emptied, tooth-fairy money, and kids begging their parents for just two more quarters.  We were so moved after counting the change one afternoon that both my daughter and I started crying.&quot;</p>
<p>The $945 Oakdale school raised went to build desks at Taru Primary school, a school of 1,011 students!  They desperately need desks.</p>
<p>Thank you Sophie and Oakdale school!</p>
